# Celestial-Combat
A game I made that uses pythons Ursina engine + websockets to make a multiplayer dragon city type game!
This game is for the hackclub shipwrecked hackathon, I wasnt able to go, but this project taught me a lot about game dev with Ursina and in general, and I also learnt quite a bit along the way.
